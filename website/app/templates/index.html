                <p> In blockchain security system, in addition to
                    logical and physical protection layers, mechanisms are established

                    participate, so that all security guarantees are provided that

                    as well as to allow the audit of the elections to be held.
                    An even more secure audit than in the traditional mail vote,
                    where the voter loses control over his or her vote.</p>
